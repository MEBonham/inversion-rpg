<NormalPage title="Welcome to Inversion">
    <section>
        <p><em>This is a place where wizards duel gunslingers at high noon. Paladins push back armies of undead with their blessed shotguns. Pirate ships sail the seas, the skies, and the stars beyond.</em></p>
        <p><em>This is a time of adventure and rediscovery. Villages are built above the wreckage of a fallen empire, and every day people unearth the magic and technology from a more advanced past.</em></p>
        <p><em>The world is a dangerous place, but itâ€™s also filled with the wonders and legends of the past. Elevators to other stars sit idle in untouched forests. Magic rivers cut paths through skyscraper mountains. Valleys filled with broken gravity let kids fly like birds above overgrown ruins of the old world.</em></p>
        <p><em>In the skies above is the Abyss, the strange space between stars. Not a cold empty vacuum devoid of life, but a place of raw creation shaped by the desires of everyone on every world.</em></p>
