## Outstanding Issues:
1. I don't know why MobileOverlay div#overlayPanelVisual is not transitioning out correctly (or incorrectly). It just doesn't transition. I want it to fade. I'm worried that it will shrink gradually due to the existing CSS `transition` property.
2. Zod validation.
3. api/v1/auth/callback and /confirm routes need to direct to an error page.
4. Error pages needed
5. Buffer Dot taller than normal text paragraph.
6. NormalDialog fills max-height attribute even if it doesn't need to.
7. TEMP Policies in RLS on Supabase.
8. How to fetch supabase foreign-key data in a single query?
